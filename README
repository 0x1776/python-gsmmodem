python-gsmmodem - GSM modem module for Python
=============================================

python-gsmmodem is a module that allows easy control of a GSM modem attached
to the system. It also includes a couple of useful commandline utilities for
interacting with a GSM modem. 

Its features include:
- simple methods for sending SMS messages, checking signal level, etc
- handling incoming phone calls and received SMS messages via callback methods
- wraps AT command errors into Python exceptions by default 
- modular design; you easily issue your own AT commands to the modem with error
  (with error checking), or read/write directly from/to the modem if you prefer

Bundled utilities:
- GSMTerm: an easy-to-use serial terminal for communicating with an attached GSM
  modem. It features command completion, built-in help for many AT commands, 
  history, context-aware prompt, etc.
- sensms.py: a simple command line script to send SMS messages
